      description: |
        Graph-tool is an efficient Python module for manipulation and statistical
        analysis of graphs. Contrary to most other Python modules with similar
        functionality, the core data structures and algorithms are implemented in
        C++, making extensive use of template metaprogramming, based heavily on
        the Boost Graph Library. This confers it a level of performance that is
        comparable (both in memory usage and computation time) to that of a pure C/C++ library.

        size range 
        from thousands to billions of edges. For this purpose, it implements
        efficient graph algorithms, 
        many of them parallel to utilize multicore architectures.

      description: |
        Raphtory is a Python package for the storage, modelling and analysis of temporal graphs/networks. It supports a very wide notion of temporal network 
        including link-streams, edges with duration and sequences of network snapshots, complemented with an expressive API for analysing the graph over different
        times and timescales. Written with scalability to large networks in mind, its core engine is written in Rust to enable memory-efficient and fast 
        computation but is wrapped in a Python module so that no Rust knowledge is required.
